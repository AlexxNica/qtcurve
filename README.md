QtCurve has recently switched hosting locations to the KDE infrastructure.

The new repo URLs are:

* read-only: git://anongit.kde.org/qtcurve

* read-write: git@git.kde.org:qtcurve

You can rewrite your existing clonedir/.git/config to use the new URLs (or
use the 'git remote ...' family of commands) and continue to use your
existing clones.
