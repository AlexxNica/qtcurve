* MDI Button order from kwinrc

* Konqueror's sidebar buttons don't work very well. Because inactive ones are 
drawn without text, its impossible to know orientation!

* right to left!
    - kde style scrollbars. when pressing > buttons, both depress.
    - qt file selector (other styles (Cleanlooks) have some issues too...)
    - shift contents to left when pressed?
        -> would need to update KDE3 and Gtk
        -> Cant just set PM_ stuff, as also move arrows, etc.

* Palette - doesnt seem to like changes!

* 'fix' for kdialog/kdefilepicker skipping taskbar, etc.

* Embedding of pixmaps
